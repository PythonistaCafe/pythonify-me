# PythonifyMe

As you know, open-source is one of the essential movement nowadays. Besides that, open-source projects are one of the vital sources to learn, discuss, grow, and increase your ability in different manners of the software development world. **However, unfortunately, finding and engaging in one of those projects is unclear, and sometimes hard, for many developers like #first-timers, and sometimes, professionals one**.

In addition to that, some projects (members, terms, rules, ...) make involving to their projects hard to the newcomers, which in turn, make them lose the chance to learn and grow together.

## The Main Goal
**The primary key of this initiative**, `PythonifyMe`, is **to mitigate the rules and terms to engage in a real open-source project and to help others to grow and learn together**. Besides that, developers will learn more about software development best-practices like testing, reviewing, fixing, refactoring, versioning, and many many things.

> You don't need to write an operating system, compiler, or any big project to learn the skills of software development. All that you need is to write one function, and you can learn a lot, a lot from it.

With one-function, you can test it, push it, refactor it, receive feedback about it, and do a lot with it.
