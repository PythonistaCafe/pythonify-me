# Nepository


We need to **learn and grow together**, and an open-source project is a gateway for this. Unfortunately, some developers, companies, and other dev-related cultures added a lot of constraints that locked that gateway. By this, we have created closed-community cultures, which, somehow, it's not related to the idea behind the word **open** in the open-source world.

Put a lot of **non-essential steps** for developers to be involved in projects will not make them learn and grow fast together. However, open-community cultures should **eliminate all of those non-essential steps**.

To solve the problem, we need to **increase** the number of open-community cultures that **mitigating** those constraints and help developers to **contribute**, **learn**, and **grow together quickly**.

## What Is A Nepository?
A **Nepository** is a **repository that eliminates/mitigates the rules of contributions**.

> **nepo/nepository**: `r` in `repo` is replaced by `n` to make it `nepo,` which is the reverse of **open** to refer to *open repository* or **nepository**.
